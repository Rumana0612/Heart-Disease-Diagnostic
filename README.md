# Heart-Disease-Diagnostic
## Objective

The primary objective of this project was to analyze heart disease data to identify key metrics, patterns, and relationships between different attributes. This analysis aimed to assist in better understanding and predicting heart disease, which can be crucial for future healthcare planning and intervention strategies.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Heart Disease Rate: Percentage of patients diagnosed with heart disease.

Average Cholesterol Levels: Average cholesterol levels for patients with and without heart disease.

Heart Disease by Thalassemia: Correlation between thalassemia types and heart disease occurrence.

Heart Disease by Chest Pain Type: Distribution of heart disease across different types of chest pain.

Resting Electrocardiographic Results (Restecg): Count of heart disease presence against different restecg values.

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: Average maximum heart rate grouped by fasting blood sugar levels.

Gender Distribution: Analysis of heart disease distribution across genders.

Age Distribution: Age-wise distribution of heart disease incidence.

## Methodology

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Data was extracted from a heart disease diagnostic database, transformed for analysis, and loaded into Power BI for visualization. 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed using Python to identify key patterns and relationships in the data.

Dashboard Creation: Built interactive visualizations in Power BI to represent findings clearly and concisely.

## Data Insights

Heart Disease Prevalence: Approximately 54.3% of the analyzed patients were diagnosed with heart disease.

Cholesterol Levels: Patients with heart disease had an average cholesterol level of 242.64 mg/dL, while those without had an average of 251.09 mg/dL.

Thalassemia: Patients with certain thalassemia types showed higher incidences of heart disease.

Chest Pain Types: Asymptomatic chest pain was less common among heart disease patients compared to other types like typical angina and non-anginal pain.

Resting ECG Results: A specific pattern in resting ECG results correlated with the presence of heart disease.

Blood Sugar Levels: Higher fasting blood sugar levels were associated with higher average maximum heart rates.

Gender and Age: The analysis included the distribution of heart disease across different age groups and genders.

## Conclusion

This project provided a comprehensive analysis of heart disease data, highlighting significant metrics and patterns that can be crucial for medical research and public health planning. The insights derived from the Power BI dashboard can help healthcare professionals better understand the factors contributing to heart disease and devise more effective preventive measures.

## Impact and Learnings

Data-Driven Decision Making: Leveraged data analytics to uncover critical health insights.

Technical Skills: Enhanced proficiency in Power BI and Python for data analysis and visualization.

Healthcare Insights: Gained deeper understanding of heart disease indicators and their relationships with various health metrics.
